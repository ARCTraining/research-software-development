<p>This Notice tells you how the University of Leeds (University) will collect and use your personal data when you access this website. The University is a &#39;controller&#39; of this personal data for the purposes of the data protection legislation.<br />
Note that additional information will be provided where you are requested to enter personal information and this will vary between our various websites. (Information will be provided through the relevant privacy notice for that website).</p>

<p>It is important that you read this Notice together with any other privacy notice we provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal data about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data.&nbsp; This Notice supplements the other notices and is not intended to override them.</p>

<h2>3. Anything you are not clear about</h2>

<h2>4. Purpose of processing your data</h2>

<p>Where we request personal data from you on our website you will be informed at that time of the purpose for which the data will be processed and how it will be processed, its legal basis for processing as well as any transfers to third parties.</p>

<h2>5. Purpose of processing - automated collection of personal information</h2>

<p>When you access our web pages certain information your browser provides, including your IP address at the time, browser type, and potentially the address of the page you last visited, will be automatically recorded by the University. This data may be used to aid detection in the event of a security breach. The legal basis for this processing is a necessity to pursue our legitimate interests to keep our website secure. The University retains this data in a form from which you may be identifiable for a period of up to one month.</p>

<h2>6. Third-party access</h2>

<p>The personal data that you have provided will not routinely be sent to third parties (unless notified - see section 4).</p>

<h3>Exception: 100% online distance learning postgraduate courses</h3>

<p>The University works with third party partners (Boundless Learning and Coursera) who handle admissions enquiries and recruitment for some of our 100% online distance learning postgraduate courses. If you submit an enquiry through the online form published on the associated course pages, our partner organisation will use your personal data to respond to your enquiry, and provide you with information on relation opportunities, if you opt-in to receive them. If you choose to apply for the course, your data will be entered into the University&rsquo;s application system so we can consider your application. These partners are only allowed to use your data in accordance with the strict instructions of the University. Neither partner will use your data in any other way nor will they share it with any other organisation.</p>

<h2>7. Data retention</h2>

<p>The University&rsquo;s policies on retaining data for prospective and current students, staff and job applicants are detailed in our <a href="https://dataprotection.leeds.ac.uk/gdpr/the-university-of-leeds-records-retention-schedule/">Data Retention Schedule</a>.</p>
